# nannou-midi
Having fun with nannou and midir crates to draw shapes and make them react to MIDI events. Trying to learn Rust in the process and to experiment stuff.

## Config

So far the MIDI device input name is hardcoded in midi.rs module. It recognises CC and note events so far, I'll see where it goes 🤷‍♂️
